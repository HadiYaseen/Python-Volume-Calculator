# Python-Volume-Calculator
A Python volume calculator that allows you to choose between a cube, rectangular box, a cylinder, and a sphere. The program generates random numbers between 5-7 (inclusive) and uses those numbers as dimensions for the chosen shape. Once that is done, the program uses said dimensions to calculate the volume of the shape.
